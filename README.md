## Description 
In this project we are going to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet. This is a regression project. 

# Project Write up/Objectives 
## Data Source 

## Data Features 
The data that we are using is of the following x-ticks 
1. 11 features
2. 8k observations
3. 2 of these are categorical
4. 3 are numerical

## Exploratory EDA. 
We would like to establish the following : 
1. Precencense of outliers
2. Precense of missing values and the missingness characteristics
3. XXX

## Modelling 
Once we establish the relationship between the features and the output variable we will test the performance of the following models 

1. Non linear models
2. Linear models.

## Model Optimization 

We will also try the fastest way to tune our model using either GridSearch and RandomSearch
